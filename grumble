"Begin with a function of arbitrary complexity. Feed it values, "sense data". Then, take your result, 
square it, and feed it back into your original function, adding a new set of sense data. Continue to 
feed your results back into the original function ad infinitum. What do you have? The fundamental 
principle of human consciousness."

be taken."

"Man's unfailing capacity to believe what he prefers to be true rather than what the evidence shows to be 
likely and possible has always astounded me. We long for a caring Universe which will save us from our

the slimmest of doubts. God has not been proven not to exist, therefore he must exist."

"We are no longer particularly in the business of writing software to perform specific tasks. We now teach

The feedback loop never really ends, so a tenth year polysentience can be a priceless jewel or a psychotic

I am, of course, pleased with your interest in my paper, and agree that the mathematical argument gets a little heavy. Of course, eliminating

Almost every problem that you come across is befuddled with all kinds of extraneous data of one sort or another; and if you can bring this problem 
down into the main issues, you can see more clearly what you’re trying to do.

- Claude Shannon
%
Suppose that you are given a problem to solve, I don’t care what kind of a problem — a machine to design, or a physical theory to develop, or a 
mathematical theorem to prove, or something of that kind — probably a very powerful approach to this is to attempt to eliminate everything from 
the problem except the essentials; that is, cut it down to size.

You have to have some kind of a drive, some kind of a desire to find out the answer, a desire to find out what makes things tick. If you don’t have

There is a vast, explored sea of nature just waiting for things to be discovered in it, and the science and technology needed are progressing at an

instrument for seeking more knowledge.

You can make a thing that is smarter than yourself. Smartness in this game is made partly of time and speed. I can build something which

The idea of a machine thinking is by no means repugnant to all of us. In fact, I find the converse idea, that the human brain may itself be 
a machine which could be possibly duplicated functionally with inanimate objects, quite attractive. Until clearly disproved, this hypothesis 
concerning the brain seems the natural scientific one in line with the principle of parsimony, etc., rather than hypothecating intangible and 
unreachable “vital forces,” “souls” and the like.

Unix was a very small, understandable OS, so people could change it at their will. It would run itself—you could type "go" and in a few minutes 
it would recompile itself. You had total control over the whole system. So it was very beneficial to a lot of people, especially at universities, 
because it was very hard to teach computing from an IBM end-user point of view. Unix was small, and you could go through it line by line and 
understand exactly how it worked. That was the origin of the so-called Unix culture.

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
