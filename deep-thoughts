 If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to

 Better not take a dog on the Space Shuttle, because if he

 To me, clowns aren't funny.  In fact, they're kinda scary.
 I've wondered where this started, and I think it goes back to

 Contrary to popular belief, the most dangerous animal in the
 world is not the lion or the tiger or even the elephant.  The
 most dangerous animal is a shark riding on an elephant, just
 trampling and eating everything they see.

 As we were driving, we saw a sign that said "Watch for Rocks".
 Marta said it should read "Watch for PRETTY Rocks".  I told
 her she should write in her suggestion to the highway department,
 but she started saying it was a joke -- just to get out of
 writing a simple letter!  And I thought I was lazy!

 As I bit into the nectarine, it had a crisp, juiciness about

 Once, when I was in Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, I met a
 mysterious old stranger.  He said he was about to die and
 wanted to tell someone about the treasure.  I said, "Okay, as
 long as it's not a long story.  Some of us have a plane to catch,
 you know.".  He started telling his story, about the treasure and
 his life and all, and I thought:  "This story isn't too long.".
 But then, he kept going, and I started thinking, "Uh-oh, this
 story is getting long.".  But then, the story was over, and I said
 to myself:  "You know, that story wasn't too long after all.".
 I forget what the story was about, but there was a good movie on
 the plane.  It was a little long, though.

 If you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is

 I guess of all my uncles, I like Uncle Cave Man the best.  We called

 The memories of my family outings are still a source of
 strength to me.  I remember we'd all pile into the car -- I
 forget what kind it was -- and drive and drive.  I'm not
 sure where we'd go, but I think there were some trees there.
 The smell of something was strong in the air as we played
 whatever sport we played.  I remember a bigger, older guy we
 called "Dad".  We would eat some stuff, or not, and then I
 think we went home.  I guess some things never leave you.

 He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land.  He loved it so
 much he made a woman out of dirt and married her.  But when he
 kissed her, she disintegrated.  Later, at the funeral, when the

 cowboy shot them.  At his hanging, he told the others, "I'll be
 waiting for you in heaven -- with a gun.".

 When the age of the Vikings came to a close, they must have sensed

 If you go parachuting, and your parachute doesn't open, and

 Sometimes when I feel like killing someone, I do a little
 trick to calm myself down.  I'll go over to the person's
 house and ring the doorbell.  When the person comes to the
 door, I'm gone.  But you know what I've left on the porch?
 A jack-o-lantern with a knife stuck in the side of its head
 with a note that says "You".  After that, I usually feel a
 whole lot better, and no harm done.

 I can still recall old Mister Barnslow getting out every morning
 and nailing a fresh load of tadpoles to that old board of his.
 Then he'd spin it round and round, like a wheel of fortune, and
 no matter where it stopped he'd yell out, "Tadpoles!  Tadpoles is
 a winner!".  We all thought he was crazy.  But then, we had some
 growing up to do.

 If I ever opened a trampoline store, I don't think I'd call it
 Trampo-Land, because you might think it was a store for tramps,
 which is not the impression we are trying to convey with our store.
 On the other hand, we would not prohibit tramps from browsing, or
 testing the trampolines, unless a tramps gyrations seemed to be
 getting out of control.

 I remember that fateful day when Coach took me aside.  I knew what
 was coming.  "You don't have to tell me.", I said.  "I'm off the
 team, aren't I.".  "Well,", said Coach, "you were never really ON
 the team.  You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and
 towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet.  You show up at
 practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to
 get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times.".
 It was all true what he was saying.  And yet, I thought,
 something is brewing inside the head of the Coach.  He sees
 something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold.  But
 that's when I felt the handcuffs go on.

 If you're at a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the

 and throw the ball to the ground.  Then say "Boy, these are
 good cigars.".

 I scrambled to the top of the precipice where Nick was waiting.
 "That was fun," I said.  "You bet it was," said Nick, "Let's

 I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there
 was going to be and eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come
 to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky."  Just
 then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you
 or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of the
 moon and all, and everybody would get a good laugh.

 Today I accidentally stepped on a snail on the sidewalk in

 One thing kids like is to be tricked.  For instance, I was

 I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was

 Sometimes the beauty of the world is so overwhelming, I just want

 Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion.  For instance, let's say
 you're and astronaut on the moon and you fear that your partner
 has been turned into Dracula.  The next time he goes out for the
 moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast
 off.  He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula,
 but you just say, "Think again, bat man."

 I wouldn't be surprised if someday some fishermen caught a big
 shark and cut it open, and there inside was a whole person.  Then
 they cut the person open, and in him is a little baby shark.  And
 in the baby shark there isn't a person, because it would be too
 small.  But there's a little doll or something, like a Johnny Combat
 little toy guy -- something like that.

 It makes me mad when I go to all the trouble of having Marta

 all you give them.  Man, wise up.

 If the Vikings were around today, they would probably be amazed

 It's not good to let any kid near a container that has a skull and

 People think it would be fun to be a bird because you could fly.
 But they forget the negative side, which is the preening.

 If I lived back in the Wild West days, instead of carrying a six-gun

 smart-aleck cowboy said something like "Hey, look.  He's carrying a
 soldering iron!" and started laughing, and everybody else started
 laughing, I could just say, "That's right, it's a soldering iron.
 The soldering iron of justice."  Then everybody would get real quiet

 When I think back on all the blessings in my life, I can't think

 If you're a circus clown, and you have a dog that you use in your

 I think a good way to get into a movie is to show up where

 Children need encouragement, so if a kid gets and answer

 Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the

 I think a good novel would be where a bunch of men on a ship are
 looking for a whale.  They look and look, but you know what?
 They never find him.  And you know why they never find him?
 It doesn't say.  The book leaves it up to you, the reader, to

 it tastes like Kool-Aid.

 Just because swans mate for life, I don't think it's that big of a deal.
 First of all, if you're a swan, you're probably not going to find a

 mate for life?

 If you're robbing a bank, and your pants suddenly fall down, I think

 You can't tell me that cowboys, when they're branding cattle, don't

 It's their way of letting off stress.

 One day one of my little nephews came up to me and asked me if

 When you first start wearing a turban, probably the most common

 If you go through a lot of hammers each month, I don't think it

 When people say that the desert is lifeless, it just makes me

 If there was a big gardening convention, and you got up and gave a

 Instead of raising your hand to ask a question in class, how about
 individual push buttons on each desk?  That way, when you want to
 ask a question, you just push the button and it lights up a
 corresponding number on a tote board at the front of the class.
 Then all the professor has to do is check the lighted number
 against a master sheet of names and numbers to see who is asking
 the question.

 If you're a boxing referee, it's probably illegal to wear a bow tie

 When you're going up the stairs and you take a step, kick the other

 When Rick told me he was having trouble with his wife, I had to

 If I was being executed by injection, I'd clean up my cell real neat.

 I'm not afraid of insects taking over the world, and you know why?
 It would take about a billion ants just to aim a gun at me, let

 and kick the gun out of their hands.

 I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not for out

 What am I afraid of?  I'll tell you:  a feather.  That's right, a

 First of all, did I say it was a poison feather?

 think I could cure it.  First, you sit the patient down and have a long
 personal talk.  After that, I'm not sure, but maybe you could throw
 some water in his face or something.

 As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red again,
 I sat there thinking about life.  Was it nothing more than a bunch of
 honking and yelling?  Sometimes it seemed that way.

 How come the dove gets to be the peace symbol?  How about the pillow?
 It has more feathers than the dove, and it doesn't have the dangerous beak.

 Even though I was their captive, the Indians allowed me quite a bit of
 freedom.  I could walk about freely, make my own meals, and even hurl
 large rocks at their heads.  It was only later that I discovered they
 were not Indians at all, but dirty clothes hampers.

 If I was a father in a waiting room, and the nurse came out and said,
 "Congratulations, it's a girl,"  I think a good gag would be to get

 and point to another father.

 The big, huge meteor headed toward the Earth.  Could nothing stop it?
 Maybe Bob could.  He was suddenly on top of the meteor -- through
 some kind of space warp or something.  "Go, Bob, go!" yelled one of
 the generals.  "Give me that!" said the big-guy general as he took
 the microphone away.  "Listen, Bob," he said.  "You've got to steer
 that meteor away from Earth."  "Yes, but how?" thought Bob.  Then he got
 an idea.  Right next to him there was a steering wheel sticking out of
 the meteor.

 If you want to be the popular one at a party, here's a good thing to do:
 Go up to some people who are talking and laughing and say, "Well,
 technically that's illegal."  It might fit in with what somebody just

 To us, it might look like just a rag.  But to the brave, embattled
 men of the fort, it was more than that.  It was a flag of surrender.
 And after that, it was torn up and used for shoe-shine rags, so the

 There are many stages in a man's life.  In the first stage, he is
 young and eager, like a beaver.  In the second stage, he wants to
 build things, like dams, and maybe chew down some trees.  In the

 what the fourth stage is.

 If aliens from outer space ever come and we show them our
 civilization and they make fun of it, we should say we were
 just kidding, that this isn't really our civilization, but
 a gag we hoped they would like.  Then we tell them to come
 back in twenty years to see our real civilization.  After that,
 we start a crash program of coming up with an impressive new
 civilization.  Either that, or just shoot down the aliens as
 they're waving goodbye.

 If you're traveling in a time machine, and you're eating corn on the cob,

 I bet if you were a mummy wrapper in ancient Egypt, one thing you

 It seemed to me that, somehow, the blue jay was trying to communicate
 with me.  I would see him fly into the house across the way, pick up
 the telephone, and dial.  My phone would ring, and it would be him,

 would yell back, but he never did speak English.

 If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at some guys,

 At first I thought, if I were Superman, a perfect secret identity would be
 "Clark Kent, Dentist," because you could save money on tooth X-rays. But then
 I thought, if a patient said, "How's my back tooth?" and you just looked
at it
 with your X-ray vision and said, "Oh it's okay," then the patient would
 probably say, "Aren't you going to take an X-ray, stupid?" and you'd say, "Aw
 fuck you, get outta here," and then he probably wouldn't even pay his bill.

 I bet when the neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone would

 Too bad you can't buy a voodoo globe so that you could make the earth spin

 The people in the village were real poor, so none of the children had any
 toys. But this one little boy had gotten an old enema bag and filled it with
 rocks, and he would go around and whap the other children across the
face with
 it. Man, I think my heart almost broke.
    Later the boy came up and offered to give me the toy. This was too much! I
 reached out my hand, but then he ran away. I chased him down and took the
 enema bag. He cried a little, but that's the way of these people.

 He was a spy, all right, and he knew it. He would walk into a room and people
 would go, "Who the fuck is that guy, a spy?" He'd laugh to himself,
maybe pull
 out his gun and show it to the person, to kind of impress him (but not
to show
 off).
    Sometimes spying was dirty work. Sometimes he'd kill a guy, then paint a
 clown face on his face. Nobody said he had to do that, but he did it anyway.
 So, dirty work.

 I bet it's hard to break farmers of the old superstitions like "Tornado got

 I don't guess I've ever been as scared as when I was waiting in the
 principal's office. Finally he came in and sat down. He didn't say anything,
 he just looked at me. Then he pulled a copy of Playboy out. "Is this yours?"
 he said.
    "No," I said, "is this yours?" And I pulled out my penis.
    I guess I wasn't as scared as I thought.

 If Alien was my friend, I'd like to be with him when he went to the dentist.

 Why do there have to be rules for everything? It's gotten to the point that

 that rules have become the foot-long sticks of mankind.

 I hate it when people say somebody has a "speech impediment", even if he
does,
 because it could hurt his feelings. So instead, I call it a "speech
 improvement", and I go up to the guy and say, "Hey, Bob, I like your speech
 improvement." I think this makes him feel better.
%
 Many people think that history is a dull subject. Dull? Is it "dull" that
 Jesse James once got bitten on the forehead by an ant, and at first it didn't
 seem like anything, but then the bite got worse and worse, so he went to a
 doctor in town, and the secretary told him to wait, so he sat down and
waited,
 and waited, and waited, and waited, and then finally he got to see the
doctor,
 and the doctor put some salve on it? You call that dull?

    No, I didn't. Just kidding. I just said that to help illustrate one of the

 kill someone for money, or something like that. Another emotion is
generosity,
 as when you pay someone double what he paid for his stupid puppet.

 Tonight, when we were eating dinner, Marta said something that really knocked

 A funny thing to do is, if you're out hiking and your friend gets bitten by a
 poisonous snake, tell him you're going to go for help, then go about ten feet
 and pretend that *you* got bit by a snake. Then start an argument with him
 about who's going to go get help. A lot of guys will start crying. That's why
 it makes you feel good when you tell them it was just a joke.

 Folks still remember the day ole Bob Riley came bouncing down that dirt road

 I wish I lived back in the old west days, because I'd save up my money for
 about twenty years so I could buy a solid-gold pick. Then I'd go out West and
 start digging for gold. When someone came up and asked what I was doing, I'd
 say, "Looking for gold, ya durn fool." He'd say, "Your pick is gold," and I'd
 say, "Well, that was easy."
    Good joke, huh.

 I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat". It's a fake baby duck, which
 you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming underwater until you find
 a mommy duck and her babies, and you join them. Then, all of a sudden, you
 stand up out of the water and roar like Godzilla. Man, those ducks
really take
 off!
    Also, Baby Duck Hat is good for parties.

 If you go to a party, and you want to be the popular one at the party, do

    I've never done this, but I think it'd work.

 I'll be the first to admit that my idea of God is pretty different. I believe
 in a God with a long white beard, a gold crown, and a long robe with lots of
 shiny jewels on it. He sits on a big throne in the clouds, and He's
about five
 hundred feet tall. He talks in a real deep voice like "I...AM...GOD!" He can
 blow up stuff just by looking at it.
    This is my own, personal idea of God.

 Too bad when I was a kid there wasn't a guy in our class that everybody
called
 the "Cricket Boy", because I would have liked to stand up in class and tell
 everybody, "You can make fun of the Cricket Boy if you want to, but to
me he's
 just like everybody else." Then everybody would leave the Cricket Boy alone,
 and I'd invite him over to spend the night at my house, but after about five
 minutes of that loud chirping I'd have to kick him out.
    Maybe later we could get up a petition to get the Cricket Family run
out of
 town. Bye, Cricket Boy.

 The whole town laughed at my great-grandfather, just because he worked hard
 and saved his money. True, working at the hardware store didn't pay much, but
 he felt it was better than what everybody else did, which was go up to the
 volcano and collect the gold nuggets it shot out every day.
    It turned out he was right. After forty years, the volcano petered out.
 Everybody left town, and the hardware store went broke. Finally he decided to
 collect gold nuggets too, but there weren't many left by then. Plus, he broke
 his leg and the doctor's bills were real high.
%
 If I had a nickname, I think I would want it to be "Prince of Weasels",

 Prince of Weasels."

 As the sleek new sports car wound its way up the tortuous road, Henri tought

 I guess more bad things have been done in the name of progress than any

 I myself have been guilty of this. When I was a teen-ager, I stole a car and

 Sometimes, when I drive across the desert in the middle of the night, with no

 Sometimes I wonder if I'm sexy enough. When I walk into a singles bar with my

 they just want to get a feel of that nice rubber manta skin?

 Life, to me, is like a quiet forest pool, one that needs a direct hit from a
 big rock half-buried in the ground. You pull and you pull, but you can't get
 the rock out of the ground. So you give it a good kick, but you lose your
 balance and go skidding down the hill toward the pool. Then out comes a big
 Hawaiian man who was screwing his wife beside the pool because they
thought it
 was real pretty. He tells you to get out of there, but you start faking it,
 like you're talking Hawaiian, and then he gets mad and chases you . . .

 pull out a big piece of meat from inside the blob of potatoes, where I've
